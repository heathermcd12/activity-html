    <h1>The Cutest Dog of All: The Labradoodle</h1>

    <p>All dogs are adorable in their own way, but <strong>Labradoodles</strong> seem to have this cuteness about them that makes you want to shriek out of pure happiness. For those that are allergic to dog hair, this dog is a godsend. Unfortunately, 10-15% of canadians are allergic to dog hair, which often means that they may never have the excitement of owning a dog. <em>Luckily</em> for them, there are a range of different dog breeds that are hypoallergenic.</p>
    
    <p>Much like the Poodle, there are three main sizes for the Labradoodle: standard, medium and miniature. Due to its hybrid nature, however, the physical characteristics of a Labradoodle may vary. For instance, a Labradoodle's coat may be wiry, wooly, wavy, curly or fleece-like. The color of the coat also varies, including cream, gold, red, black, chocolate, brindle and multi-patterned. Contrary to belief, some Labradoodles do shed, though far less, and with less odor than that of a Labrador Retriever.</p>
